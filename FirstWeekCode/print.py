lyrics = """ Love me two times baby
Love me twice today
Love me two times girl
I'm goin' away
Love me two times girl
One for tomorrow, one just for today
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me one time
Could not speak
Love me one time
Yeah, my knees got weak
Love me two times girl
Last me
All through the week
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Oh yeah
Love me one time
Could not speak
Love me one time, baby
Yeah, my knees got weak
Love me two times girl
Last me
All through the week
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me twoâ€¦
